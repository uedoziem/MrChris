        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
            There have been no better time to invest in the FOREX market than now, considering the freefall of our nation's currency, against the dollar. 
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
            However, some smart fellows have profited immensely from this dilemma by investing in the FOREX Market
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
            This is why this webinar is very timely, where you would learn the few tricks required to beat the FOREX Market everytime
        </p>
        <p>
            Have you ever asked yourself why the banks record massive profits, even in recessions? You actually think it is just from loan repayment or charges from their services?
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            The Banks are heavy FOREX traders. Where is such huge amount, over <b> $6.6 Trillion </b> that is traded daily come from? 
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            It is estimated that 5% of of traders are banks but the amount traded by those banks accounts for over 92% of total volume traded. 
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            Now think about this: 92% of that humongous volume comes from the banks ALONE, which accounts for just 5% of the total FOREX traders. 
            The 95% of the traders are just speculators. That is why banks does not lose money in any sense.
