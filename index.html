        <h3>
            What exactly is Dropshipping?
        </h3>
        <br />
        <p>
            Dropshipping is a branch of Ecommerce, with a business model that allows entrepreneurs to sell products that are manufactured, warehoused and shipped
            by vendors from their own online store. 
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            What this means is this:
        </p>
        <br />
        <p><ul>
            <li>One do not manufacture the products</li>
            <li>One do not warehouse the products</li>
            <li>One do not ship/deliver the products</li>
        </ul></p>
        <br />
        <p>
            And surprisingly, One may not even see the product at all.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            Dropshipping is a great option for first-time entrepreneurs. 
            It frees up time that can be refocused on marketing and provides a better way for small businesses to test out new product ideas 
            without having to own and pay for the product upfront. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In short, dropshipping is the act of selling a product on your website without actually handling its fulfillment and shipping. 
            Another key benefit of dropshipping is that one don’t pay for the product until the customer pays for it, 
            making dropshipping an viable option for people who don't want to spend a lot on initial inventory or who don’t want to risk buying products that won’t sell. 
            This low barrier to entry allows novices and professionals alike to pick a niche and run their own dropshipping-based ecommerce store.

        <h3>
            DROPSHIPPING BUSINESS MODEL
        </h3>
        <p>
            In the pictorial description above, 
        </p>
        <p><ul>
             <li>A dropshipper owns an online store called "Your Store" that sells clothes. He then, for instance, added a markup price of $30 to each of his products on his store.</li>
             <li> A Customer goes to his store and orders and purchases a cloth at $100.</li>
             <li>Because his store is already connected to a platform, his vendor is automatically notified and delivers the goods to his customer.</li>
             <li>The vendor collects his charge of $70 while $30 becomes his and is credited to his account</li>
        </ul></p>
        <p>
           Now, i want you to notice something exciting about this business model:
        </p>
        <p><ul>
             <li>The dropshipper did not see the product!</li>
             <li>The dropshipper did not manufacture the product!</li>
             <li>The dropshipper did not deliver the product!</li>
        </ul></p>
        <br />
        <p>
            All was done automatically from the dropshipper's online store that is connected to a platform. All the dropshipper will do are:
        </p>
        <p><ul>
            <li>Ensure that he/she is driving traffic to his/her online store</li>
            <li>Ensure that the traffic he/she brings buys the goods in his/her online store</li>
        </ul></p>
        <br />
        <p><b>
            This is where the work is. Just having an online store is not enough!!! A dropshipper has to know/have two skills, amongst other:

            <li><i>Social-Media Marketing.</i></li>
        </ul></p>
        <br />
        <p>
            The advantages of this business model are these: 
        </p>
        <p><ul>
            <li>One do not store any inventory</li>
            <li>One do not ship/deliver any inventory</li>
            <li>One do not manufacture any inventory</li>
            <li>And lastly but most importantly, One can sell goods to any country</li>
