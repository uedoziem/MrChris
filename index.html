            What exactly is Dropshipping?
        </b></p>
        <br />
        <p>
            Dropshipping is a branch of Ecommerce, with a business model that allows entrepreneurs to sell products that are manufactured, warehoused and shipped
            by vendors from their own online store. 
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            What this means is this:
        </p>
        <br />
        <p><ul>
            <li>You do not manufacture the products</li>
            <li>You do not warehouse the products</li>
            <li>You do not ship/deliver the products</li>
        </ul></p>
        <br />
        <p>
            And surprisingly, you may not even see the product at all.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            Dropshipping is a great option for first-time entrepreneurs. 
            It frees up time that can be refocused on marketing and provides a low-risk way for small businesses to test out new product ideas 
            without having to own and pay for the product upfront. 
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            A Pictorial View of how this works is in the image below:

            DROPSHIPPING BUSINESS MODEL
        </b></p>
        <p>
            In the pictorial description above, 
        </p>
        <p><ul>
             <li>A dropshipper owns an online store called "Your Store" that sells clothes. He then, for instance, added a markup price of $30 to each of his products on his store.</li>
             <li> A Customer goes to his store and orders and purchases a cloth at $100.</li>
             <li>Because your store is already connected to a platform, your vendor is automatically notified and delivers the goods to your customer</li>
             <li>Then the profit of $30 becomes yours and is credited to your account</li>
        </ul></p>
        <p>
           Now, i want you to notice something exciting about this business model:
        </p>
        <p><ul>
             <li>The dropshipper did not see the product!</li>
             <li>The dropshipper did not manufacture the product!</li>
             <li>The dropshipper did not deliver the product!</li>
        </ul></p>
        <br />
        <p>
            All was done automatically from the dropshipper's online store that is connected to a platform. All the dropshipper must do are:
        </p>
        <br />
        <p><ul>
            <li>Enure that he/she is driving traffic to his/her online store</li>
            <li>Enure that the traffic he/she brings purchases the goods in his/her online store</li>
        </ul></p>
        <br />
        <p><b>
            This is where the work is. Just having an online store is not enough!!! A dropshipper must know/have two skills
